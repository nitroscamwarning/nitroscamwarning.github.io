        <h1>FAQ: You are stupid</h1>
        <p><strong>Q: What?! Why?!</strong></p>
        <p>A: You clicked a scam link. You are stupid. If it was real you would have gotten your discord account stolen.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: How was I supposed to know it was fake?</strong></p>
        <p>A: The only real discord links will come from discord.com, or if it's through another retailer, through their website like epicgames.com or steampowered.com.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: How would they have stolen my account?</strong></p>
        <p>A: They would have asked for your username and password, which you would have typed because you are stupid and clicked the link. It's possible that there might be some exploit where they could've gotten your account without you inputting the info!</p>
        <p><strong>Q: I only clicked the link because I knew it was a scam and wanted to investigate</strong></p>
        <p>A: Good for you</p>
        <p><strong>Q: I'm mad at you for calling me out >:(</strong></p>
        <p>A: Cry about it</p>
